## CaC Infra Automation

CaC Infra Automation is a comprehensive repository designed to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning and configuration. The repository leverages the principles of Configuration as Code (CaC) to enable consistent, reliable, and scalable deployments across multiple environments. It supports various cloud providers, including AWS and Azure, making it a versatile tool for managing complex infrastructure setups.

## Features

### 1. **Configuration as Code (CaC)**

- Ensures version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.
- Reduces the chances of human error during provisioning.

### 2. **Multi-Cloud Support**

- Provides templates and modules for AWS and Azure cloud providers.
- Easily extendable to include additional providers.

### 3. **Environment Management**

- Organizes infrastructure configurations for different environments such as development, staging, and production.
- Streamlines the process of applying environment-specific configurations.

### 4. **Automation Tools**

- Uses Terraform and Terragrunt for defining and deploying infrastructure.
- Simplifies the management of complex dependencies between resources.

### 5. **Scalability and Modularity**

- Modular structure promotes reuse of components across projects.
- Scalable to meet the demands of large-scale cloud deployments.

### Key Folders and Files

#### `environments/`

This folder contains subdirectories for each environment. Each subdirectory holds the configurations and variable files specific to the respective environment.

#### `modules/`

Reusable Terraform modules for cloud resources like VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more.

#### `scripts/`

Helper scripts for automation tasks such as initializing Terraform, formatting code, and running security checks.

#### `terraform.tfvars`

Holds global variable definitions used across the repository. This file can be customized based on the target environment.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Terraform**
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for defining and provisioning cloud resources.
2. **Terragrunt**
   - Wrapper for Terraform that simplifies configurations and manages dependencies.
3. **AWS CLI**
   - Command-line interface for interacting with AWS resources.
4. **Azure CLI**
   - Command-line interface for managing Azure resources.
5. **Git**
   - Version control for tracking changes to configurations.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Installed Tools:**

   - Terraform
   - Terragrunt
   - AWS CLI / Azure CLI
   - Git

2. **Cloud Accounts:**

   - Valid AWS or Azure account credentials with appropriate permissions.

3. **Access Tokens:**

   - Configure authentication for your cloud provider(s).

4. **Environment Setup:**

   - Ensure your local machine is configured with the necessary environment variables (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for AWS).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/callistox9/CaC-infra-automation.git
cd CaC-infra-automation
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform and Terragrunt

```bash
terragrunt init
```

### 3. Select an Environment

Navigate to the desired environment directory:

```bash
cd environments/dev
```

### 4. Plan and Apply

Plan and apply infrastructure changes:

```bash
terragrunt plan
terragrunt apply
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Modules Effectively:**

   - Keep modules generic and reusable.
   - Version your modules to ensure compatibility.

2. **Environment Segmentation:**

   - Isolate configurations for each environment to minimize risk.

3. **Secure Secrets:**

   - Store sensitive information in secure vaults or use environment variables.

4. **Enable Logging:**

   - Implement logging for all infrastructure changes to track modifications.

5. **Run Tests:**

   - Regularly validate and test configurations using tools like `terraform validate`.
